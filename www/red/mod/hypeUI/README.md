## Features

 * Strips core CSS and rewrites everything from scratch using [Bulma.io](http://bulma.io)
 * Reimagines layouts, item views and navigation
 

## Notes

Note that this plugin/theme will likely have incompatibilities with other third party plugins.
The intention here is not to ensure broad compatibility, rather to demonstrate best practices for reducing boilerplate and implementing scalable/extendable themes.
