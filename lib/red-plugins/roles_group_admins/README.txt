Implements the Group Administrator role via the Roles framework
===============================================================

This plugin adds more granular access to your site by introducing a new user role: Group Administrator. 

When using this plugin, regular members of your site won't be able to create groups. A user has to be a Group
Administrator to create a new group.

To appoint one of your users as a Group Administrator, change this user's role to 'Group Administrator'.
You can do this by going to the user's settings page, which is something like http://your-site-url/settings/user/username
Alternatively, you can also grant and revoke Group Admin privileges via the user icon hover menu.
Make sure you're logged in as an admin user - this is required to change user roles.

The plugin requires the Roles framework - make sure you install and enable that one first.
