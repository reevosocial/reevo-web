A MediaWiki extension which extends the link syntax to allow custom attributes, such as rel="author".

==Release ==
[https://github.com/rotsee/LinkAttributes/tags 0.1]

==Dependencies==
MediaWiki 1.19

==Installation==
Upload to your extensions folder, and add the following settings to LocalSettings.php:
require_once("$IP/extensions/LinkAttributes/LinkAttributes.php");

==Usage==
Extra attributes are added at the end of a link, separated with a pipe (|) or a broken pipe (¦), like this:

[[User:James|my page|rel=author]]

[http://twitter.com/leo_wallentin my Twitter account|rel=me]

Allowed properties are: rel, rev, charset, type, hreflang and itemprop.

In some places (such as inside templates with tables) the pipe can be hard to use, as it has special meanings to MediaWiki. Therefore a broken pipe (¦) will also work with this extension: [[Oranges|Oranges¦itemprop=fruit]].
Note that the following will NOT work: [[User:James|rel=author]], as this extension has no way of knowing if rel=author is supposed to be an attribute or the actual text to be linked. The link would have to be written like this: [[User:James|James|rel=author]]. Also note that after installing this extension, pipes will not work in link texts.
